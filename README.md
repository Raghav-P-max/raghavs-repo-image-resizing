## Here is how my program works:

First, it asks the user to enter value of width and height for resizing the image.
Next, it goes through every image ending with .jpg, .png, .jpeg, or .gif extension in 'images' folder. 

## HOW PIL WORKS:
PIL is a module from where we can use the Image() function.
Each selected image is opened using PIL and resized to the specific height and width entered by the user.
It saves all the new images in the 'resized images' folder with the same file names.
For each image that has been resized the program prints it and also saves it in the 'resized images' folder.

## OLD IMAGE(NON-RESIZED):

This is an image before resizing from 'images' folder: 'Old Thumbnail.jpg' in this repo
This is an image after resizing from 'resized images' folder: 'Thumbnail.jpg' in this repo
after entering the width as 6000 and height as 7000.
